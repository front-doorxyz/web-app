We let companies list their open roles with a recruitment bounty on the blockchain, incentivizing their community and our ecosystem of talent partners - freelance recruiters, agencies, communities, job boards, HR tech businesses, publications… - to help attract top talent.\n\nWe believe that by enforcing the right incentives, we can make recruiting much more efficient. E.g. candidates only apply to jobs they’re really interested in, referrers only refer candidates to jobs that fit well, and companies run efficient interviewing processes. Our goal is to encode these incentives using blockchain and smart contract technology, to build a fair & transparent protocol that can serve as the infrastructure layer for a thriving recruiting industry.\n\nWe currently focus on the web3 industry, where we are already working for some of the strongest brands like Binance, Gnosis, No fun, CoW Protocol, Airbuns and many more. In only a few weeks, we’ve placed 12 people and received thousands of applications.\n\nWe recently raised a 1.5m USD by Tioga Capital, Portal Ventures and some amazing angel investors, and are looking to expand our team to become the standard for matching talent and opportunity.\n\n[b]About the role[/b]\nYou’ll be the first full time software developer on the team, building out the product together with our technical co-founder, Boris. You’ll be responsible for the full life-cycle of new features: speccing, discussing, implementing, testing, releasing and maintaining. We’re looking for someone that is pragmatic, takes initiative and combines technical prowess and product intuition to go from vague specs to a minimal but satisfactory implementation in no-time, often involving some design work and user interaction.\n\nYour work will involve mostly full-stack (web) work, but is likely to branch out into web3 technology (smart contracts) and/or ML / AI and data science.\n\nOur tech stack is TypeScript based and relies on no-code tools wherever it makes sense. We’re very keen to adopt new technologies when they’re the best fit for the job.\n\nSome of the things you’ll be working on:\n[ml][ul][li indent=0 align=left]Building new features in our front- and backend to improve our product for candidates, recruiters and clients[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Automate candidate follow-up through Slack, Emails and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSes)[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Help research, plan and implement the best way to gradually decentralize the Job Protocol platform into a set of autonomous and permissionless smart contracts[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Help our operation team by automating as much of the candidate-review process as possible (probably involving ML)[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Build out our data infrastructure and dashboards[/li][/ul][/ml]\n[b]Requirements[/b]\n[ml][ul][li indent=0 align=left]You live in Europe or the UK[/li][li indent=0 align=left]You're looking for a full time role (no freelancing or part time contracts)[/li][li indent=0 align=left]2-5y experience as a full stack developer at a tech company, preferably a fast growing startup[/li][li indent=0 align=left]You have a CS degree[/li][li indent=0 align=left]You have a track record that shows passion for software development and experimenting with new technologies[/li][li indent=0 align=left]You have experience with React / Next, NodeJS and SQL (Postgress)[/li][li indent=0 align=left]You combine technical prowess and a product intuition.

We let companies list their open roles with a recruitment bounty on the blockchain, incentivizing their community and our ecosystem of talent partners - freelance recruiters, agencies, communities, job boards, HR tech businesses, publications… - to help attract top talent.\nWe believe that by enforcing the right incentives, we can make recruiting much more efficient. E.g. candidates only apply to jobs they’re really interested in, referrers only refer candidates to jobs that fit well, and companies run efficient interviewing processes. Our goal is to encode these incentives using blockchain and smart contract technology, to build a fair & transparent protocol that can serve as the infrastructure layer for a thriving recruiting industry.\nWe currently focus on the web3 industry, where we are already working for some of the strongest brands like Binance, Gnosis, No fun, CoW Protocol, Airbuns and many more. In only a few weeks, we’ve placed more than a dozen people and received thousands of applications.\nWe recently raised a 1.5m USD by Tioga Capital, Portal Ventures and some amazing angel investors, and are looking to expand our team to become the standard for matching talent and opportunity.\n\n[h3][b]About the role[/b][/h3]\nAs the Business Development and Partnerships Manager at Job Protocol, you will be responsible for identifying and pursuing new opportunities to grow the Job Protocol network.

This will require you to conduct market research in hiring needs to identify potential clients and partners within the crypto industry which is our initial target segment, as well as building and maintaining relationships with them.\nIn this role, you will be in charge of business development and will work closely with the founders on setting out the right strategies which will be a combination of sales, marketing, and product development, to ensure that our network grows at fast pace.\nTo be successful in this role, you should have a strong background in b2b business development and partnerships, preferably with experience in the crypto industry. You should have excellent communication and negotiation skills, as well as the ability to build and maintain relationships with a wide range of partners and clients in the crypto space. A strong understanding of the crypto market and current trends, as well as a track record of driving company growth, is also essential.\nOverall, the Business Development and Partnerships Manager will play a crucial role in driving our company's growth and success through the identification and pursuit of new business opportunities within the crypto industry.\nKnowledge of blockchain technology and how it relates to the recruitment industry is preferred.
